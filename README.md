Are you wondering have to move your FiveM server to another level?🧠

I have solution for you. I created WhiteList form bot.😏
Which is more user friendly then classic whitelist interview.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

How it works??🔧

Firts the user must click on Button in selected channel. 
Then bot sends user Firts question after users answer bot send another question and this will least until the end of form.
After that bot sends embed to Admin channel where admin can approve ✅ or decline it ❌.
If admin approves it bot send message to user and give him choosen role and remove the old one
But if admin declines form he must give write reason for decling. After that user will get message with reason and old role will stay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 All messages can be edited for you 
📌 All rooms and roles must be add
